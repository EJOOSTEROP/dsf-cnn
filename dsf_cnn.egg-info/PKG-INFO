Description: # Dense Steerable Filter CNNs for Expoiting Rotational Symmetry in Histology Images
        
        A densely connected rotation-equivariant CNN for histology image analysis. <br />
        
        [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03037) to the paper. <br />
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Environment instructions: 
        
        ```
        conda create --name dsf-cnn python=3.6
        conda activate dsf-cnn
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Repository Structure 
        
        - `src/` contains executable files used to run the model. Further information on running the code can be found in the corresponding directory.
        - `loader/`contains scripts for data loading and self implemented augmentation functions.
        - `misc/`contains util scripts. 
        - `model/class_pcam/` model architecture for dsf-cnn on PCam dataset 
        - `model/seg_nuc/` model architecture for dsf-cnn on Kumar dataset 
        - `model/seg_gland/` model architecture for dsf-cnn on CRAG dataset 
        - `model/utils/` contains util scripts for the models. 
        - `opt/` contains scripts that define the model hyperparameters and augmentation pipeline. 
        - `config.py` is the configuration file. Paths need to be changed accordingly.
        - `train.py` and `infer.py` are the training and inference scripts respectively.
        - `process.py` is the post processing script for obtaining the final instances for segmentation.
